Heart disease prediction :
Collect relevant data such as patient age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical history indicators.
Preprocess the data to create meaningful features for the model, including normalization and handling missing values.
Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm, such as logistic regression or a neural network, to train on the data.
Train the model, evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy or AUC, and use it to predict the likelihood of heart disease in new patients.
